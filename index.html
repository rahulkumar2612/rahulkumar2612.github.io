            <h2>CandleSticks, The 101 stuff of trading!</h2>
            <p>
                We all have at some point in our lives thought about trading, hearing about successful traders like Buffet and Elder have surely motivated us to
                try it out once. Once we start, things happen in a particular order, as soon as we see the trading charts for the first time, we get overwhelmed by it,
                then we look up for resources to learn about what those charts are so as to make some sense of the 'random' patterns we saw, the topics are mostly
                presented in a well....not so beginner friendly manner and we get overwhelmed again :(<br>Some of us will quit straightaway while few courageous ones will
                still try out their luck and start trading, and of course they lose all the money they put in the broker's account.
                </p>
                <p>
                Beacuse to be successful in trading you ought to have a technique you rely on to the core and have a strict emotional discipline, that's it!
                That's it, those are the only two things these great traders say are required to be succesful in this area.
                Emotional discipline is something which varies from person to person and takes time to develop, the second thing about technique is what we will focus on.
                I have tried here to help you understand the fundamentals of trading, the most important of them being the candlesticks, they will form the meat of most of
                this website. The resources are curated in the most beginner friendly way to help you take your first step to becoming a succesful trader.
                The ideal path of training would be to first cover up the basic cocepts on candlesticks, then take the basic quiz, if you ace it, consume
                the advance content next and finally take the advance quiz to test your concepts(Note: Advance content is not yet available and should be live in few weeks).
                At the end of it, you would have certainly learnt a good deal about candlesticks and then can create a personal technique solely based on it or use one of many
                we will be discussing here. Then start to apply them in real trading scenarios and see the difference!!
                So without wasting any more time, let's get started...
