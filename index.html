        Hi, This is Rahul Kumar. A "newbie" software engineer looking to make a mark in this domain having found an
        interest in building a career creating products people would love to use.
        For a start I have been inclined towards building web apps, mainly because it's fastest way to see your content
        going live. The satisfaction it gives when people use your site is simply unmatched and something I had never
        experienced before.
        For now I only have the following projects that I have worked on, please have a look, any feedback would be
        deeply appreciated.
