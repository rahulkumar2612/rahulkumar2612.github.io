          <p class="lead">Hi, This is Rahul Kumar. Currently working as an embedded software engineer who loves creating products that makes people come back to them again and again :)<br>
          I have recently begun
          to explore other domains in the wide enerprise of software development, mainly in web and automation. Both of these fields have kept me intrigued for a while and I am looking
          to make a mark in these domains having found an interest in building a career creating products people would love to use.<br><br>
          For a start I have been inclined towards building web apps, mainly because it's fastest way to see your content
          going live. The satisfaction it gives when people use your site is simply unmatched and something I had never
          experienced before.
          For now I only have the following projects that I have worked on, please have a look, any feedback would be
          deeply appreciated.</p>
          <hr class="my-4">
          <p>My first website! Here I have tried to provide some beginner level info on the most basic trading pattern, Candlesticks! It has a few slides
          describing about the pattern followed by a quiz. Used JavaScript to create the slider effects and keep track of progress in learn and quiz sections.
          Mostly raw css is used, though buttons and the home page carousel is "bootstrapped".</p>

          <hr class="my-4">
          <p>My first web-app! This is a virtual trading app created using Python based micro framework Flask. Registered users get virtual money ($10k to start with)
          Users can buy stock, build their portfolio and sell stock to cash in on their profits, getting a chance to test their trading strategies before investing real money.
          History of transactions is provided along with a leaderboard position. Live market data is provided by integrating a 3rd party api. Site is currently hosted on pythonanywhere.com using WSGI server.
          Tech Stack: Flask, Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap.</p>
