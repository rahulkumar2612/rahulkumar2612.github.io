          <p class="lead">Hi, This is Rahul Kumar. Currently working as an embedded software engineer who wants to create products that makes people come back to them again and again :)<br>
          I have recently begun 
          to explore other domains in the wide enerprise of software development, mainly in web and automation. Both of these fields have kept me intrigued for a while and I am looking 
          to make a mark in these domains having found an interest in building a career creating products people would love to use.<br><br>
          For a start I have been inclined towards building web apps, mainly because it's fastest way to see your content
          going live. The satisfaction it gives when people use your site is simply unmatched and something I had never
          experienced before.
          For now I only have the following projects that I have worked on, please have a look, any feedback would be
          deeply appreciated.</p>
          <hr class="my-4">
          <p>My first website! Here I have tried to provide some beginner level info on the most basic trading technique, Candlesticks!. It has a few slides
          describing about the patterns and a quiz follows. Used JavaScript to create the slider effects. Mostly HTML5 is used along with raw css, though buttons
          and the home page carousel is "bootstrapped".</p>
