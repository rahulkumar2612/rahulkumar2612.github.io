          <p class="lead">Hi, This is Rahul Kumar. A "newbie" software engineer looking to make a mark in this domain having found an
          interest in building a career creating products people would love to use.
          For a start I have been inclined towards building web apps, mainly because it's fastest way to see your content
          going live. The satisfaction it gives when people use your site is simply unmatched and something I had never
          experienced before.
          For now I only have the following projects that I have worked on, please have a look, any feedback would be
          deeply appreciated.</p>
          <hr class="my-4">
          <p>My first website! Here I have tried to provide some beginner level info on the most basic trading pattern, Candlesticks!. It has a few slides
          describing about the pattern and a quiz follows. Used JavaScript to create the slider effects. Mostly raw css is used, though buttons
          and the home page carousel is "bootstrapped".</p>
